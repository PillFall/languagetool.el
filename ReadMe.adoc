This package was based on
link:https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-langtool/[mhayashi1120
Emacs-Langtool], it's intended to make a pipeline through Emacs and
parse JSON output, making it incompatible with the original version,
that's why this package is not a forked version and it's made from
scratch.

LanguageTool is an open source proof-reading tool built in Java which
supports more than 30 languages.



== Installation

=== Obtaining the prerequisites

The first thing you need is *Java*, so download and install it.

You also need to download
*link:https://languagetool.org/download/[LanguageTool]* from its
official page.

After download, extract the contents in a folder you want
(e.g. `~/.languagetool/`).


=== Configuring the package

Next you need to set the package configuration. First we add the path
to the `languagetool-commandline.jar` file in your `.emacs` file like:

[source, lisp]
----
(setq languagetool-language-tool-jar
      "~/.languagetool/languagetool-commandline.jar")
----

Or via customize.  It's highly encouraged to use full path instead.

If you are going to use the LanguageTool HTTP Server instead, you need
to add to your `.emacs` file:

[source, lisp]
----
(setq languagetool-server-language-tool-jar
      "~/.languagetool/languagetool-server.jar")
(languagetool-server-start)
----

It's recommended to add a Java flag to process the files in UTF-8, so
you should add to your `.emacs`:

[source, lisp]
----
(setq languagetool-java-arguments '("-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"))
----

And finally you should tell which language are you using by default in
your `.emacs` file like:

[source, lisp]
----
(setq languagetool-default-language "en-GB")
----

You can change this latter using `languagetool-set-language` function.



== Usage

There are 5 commands than can be used directly and bound to a key if
desired.

* `languagetool-check` To check the active region or the buffer.
* `languagetool-clear-buffer` To delete all the buffer highlights.
* `languagetool-correct-at-point` To correct the warning at point.
* `languagetool-correct-buffer` To correct the whole buffer.
* `languagetool-set-language` To change correction language.

For this package the suggested keybinding is:

[source, lisp]
----
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c l c") 'languagetool-check)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c l d") 'languagetool-clear-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c l p") 'languagetool-correct-at-point)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c l b") 'languagetool-correct-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c l l") 'languagetool-set-language)
----

Once you are correcting with build in functions it will pop-up a
correction buffer at the minibuffer, you only need to choose.

Or you can use a LanguageTool HTTP Server with
`languagetool-server-mode`.  In this mode the function
`languagetool-check` will be undefined in the current buffer to
prevent checking with another tool.  `languagetool-clear-buffer`
clears and recheck the buffer in case of needed.  The other functions
works as usual.



== Customizable Variables

For this package there are a few customizable variables that should be
set in order to take control of LanguageTool suggestions.

* `languagetool-java-bin` Sets the path to the JAVA executable, if it
  is in `PATH` only it's name is needed. Set to `"java"` by default.
* `languagetool-java-arguments` If you need to pass arguments to JAVA
  set this variable.  It must be a list of strings, one string for
  each argument without spaces.
+
e.g.
+
[source,lisp]
----
(setq languagetool-java-arguments '("-flag1" "-flag2"))
;; or
(setq languagetool-java-arguments '("-flag" "argumentforflag")
----
* `languagetool-language-tool-class` Tell the package that the package
  will use the class files directly.  Set to `nil` by default.
* `languagetool-language-tool-jar` Sets the path of the LanguageTool
  command line jar file.  It's recommended to put the full path.
* `languagetool-language-tool-arguments` Sets arguments to pass to
  LanguageTool.  It must be a list of strings, one string for each
  argument without spaces.
+
e.g.
+
[source,lisp]
----
(setq languagetool-language-tool-arguments '("-flag1" "-flag2"))
;; or
(setq languagetool-language-tool-arguments '("-flag" "argumentforflag")
----
* `languagetool-server-language-tool-jar` Sets the path of the
  LanguageTool Server jar file.  It's recommended to put the full
  path.
* `languagetool-default-language` Sets the LanguageTool correction
  language.  It can be changed via command with
  `languagetool-set-language`.
* `languagetool-mother-tongue` If set LanguageTool behaviour change to
  correct using `languagetool-default-language` but being aware of
  false friends.
* `languagetool-disabled-rules` Tells LanguageTool to ignore these
  rules when checking text.
* `languagetool-local-disabled-rules` As `languagetool-disabled-rules`
  tells LanguageTool to ignore these rules when checking text but it's
  buffer local, so if you want you can set it in your local variables
  comment.
* `languagetool-server-url` Tells LanguageTool Server mode to send
  POST request to this url.  Set to `"http://localhost"` by default.
* `languagetool-server-port` Tells LanguageTool Server mode to send
  Post request to this port.  Set to `8081` by default.
* `languagetool-server-delayed-commands` A list of hooks for sending a
  request to the server.
* `languegetool-server-request-delay` Controls the number og seconts
  while idle before this package sends a new request to the
  LanguegeTool Server.
